# Image-Classification
Second Project on my course of Deep Learning on Udacity.

In this project, I classified images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset needs to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. I normalized the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, I could see their predictions on the sample images.
